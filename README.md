# PROJECT 2 - RANDOM FINANCIAL STOCK PORTFOLIO SITE

My goal with this project was to have a functional, simulated brokerage site in which a user could input a ticker symbol for a desired stock into a form and have an API return that company's name, current price (or last closing price for the sake of cost), and a description of the company (or if not, leave a blank field in the form for the user to leave notes in).

Due to time constraints and my having spent a lot of time on making my routes' functionality and ensuring individual accounts had their own unique list of stocks, I was unable to implement the API.

### Technologies Used:
-express (server)
-node (package manager)
-mongodb (database)
-ejs (embedded JavaScript, for JS functionality within html)
-express-session (for user authorization)
-jquery (installed but unused due to lack of API implementation)
-mongoose (communication between server and database)
